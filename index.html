    was a British statesman and Labour Party politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951. It is said that when Attlee went to see King George at Buckingham Palace to be appointed Prime Minister, the notoriously laconic Attlee and the famously tongue-tied King stood in silence; Attlee finally volunteered the remark, "I've won the election." The King replied "I know. I heard it on the Six O'Clock News".
